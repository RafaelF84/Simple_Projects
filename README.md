# Medical Appointments

A simple desktop application for managing medical appointments, built with Java Swing.

## Features

- **Register Patients:** Add new patients with name and ID.
- **Register Doctors:** Add new doctors with name and license number.
- **Schedule Appointments:** Select a patient, doctor, and date/time to schedule an appointment. Prevents double-booking for doctors.
- **View Appointments:** See all scheduled appointments in a table.
- **Modern UI:** Uses [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) for a modern look and feel (with fallback to Nimbus).
- **Tabbed Interface:** Easy navigation between registration, scheduling, and viewing.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Add FlatLaf to your project dependencies.**
   - Download from [FlatLaf releases](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/releases) or add via Maven/Gradle.
   - Place the FlatLaf JAR (and optionally FlatLaf IntelliJ Themes JAR) in your classpath.
3. **Compile the project:**
   ```sh
   javac -cp ".;path/to/flatlaf.jar;path/to/flatlaf-intellij-themes.jar" src/**/*.java
   ```
4. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   java -cp ".;path/to/flatlaf.jar;path/to/flatlaf-intellij-themes.jar;src" src.Main
   ```

```


## Dependencies

- Java 8 or higher
- [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) (for modern UI)
- (Optional) FlatLaf IntelliJ Themes for extra themes

## Customization

- **Icons:** Place your PNG icons in `resources/icons/` and update the paths in `MainWindow.java`.
- **Themes:** Change the FlatLaf theme in `Main.java` for a different look (e.g., FlatLightLaf, FlatDarkLaf, FlatArcDarkIJTheme, etc).

## Limitations

- Data is stored in memory only (no database or file persistence).
- Appointment conflict checking only prevents exact date/time overlaps for doctors.
- No search/filter in the appointments list (can be added as an enhancement).
